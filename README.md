Project Description

* My application is called BlockBuster. It is supposed to highlight the glorious days of one of the most pivotal Video-renting services of all time. In this project, my mission is to bring blockbuster back to life with a little bit more exitement and modernism. Overall what this application is set to is show any movie you look for and give you details about it. It will also feature a popular movie section. Among other things.


Wireframes 



MVP 

* A connection to TMDB API, to atleast display popular movies
* A Mobile friendly design 
* A navigation using react router 
* A context of some sort when clicling a particular movie

STRECH 

* A link to the movie trailer somewhere
* A set of smooth animations 
* Replicating the blockbuster feel 

API

* https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

Component Hierarchy 








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
